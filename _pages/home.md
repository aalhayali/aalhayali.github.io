Hi! I am an independent researcher in computer vision and machine learning. My research expertise lies within medical image segmentation, classification, and quality assurance. I like to write about technical topics I find interesting and entrepreneurship.

Presently, I am working independently as a computer vision researcher and advisor. I work with early-stage medical imaging startups to construct and build their predictive models. I also volunteer as a co-lead for the ML in Healthcare discussion group for [Aggregate Intellect](https://ai.science/). Prior to that, I was a graduate student at the University of Guelph, working with [Dr. Eran Ukwatta](https://www.uoguelph.ca/engineering/people/eranga-ukwatta-phd-peng) from the [GIAI lab](https://imagingailab.uoguelph.ca/) and [Amin Komeili](https://profiles.ucalgary.ca/amin-komeili) from [iHadLab](https://www.ihadlab.com/). Throughout my master's, I worked as an AI Scientist for [AI Vali Inc.](https://www.ai-vali.com/), I also worked on a variety of collaborative projects including image quality assessment (IQA), semi-supervised segmentation, and a variety of supervised methods. 

Before my complete immersion in machine learning I spent time in industry and academia working on interesting biomedical and systems engineering projects. I worked on an EEG brain translation device for hospitalised patients that translates their brainwaves to simple commands such as turning a TV on/off, reclining their hospital bed, and calling a nurse. Also, I developed an automated cannabis growth incubator which can be used by small scale growers and farms (__fun fact - won most innovative engineering project in fall 2019!__). Lastly, I worked on 2 year long commercialisation project, developing an assistive wrist brace for Carpall tunnel patients with [Dr. Karen Gordon](https://www.uoguelph.ca/ceps/people/karen-gordon) and [Dr. Michelle Oliver](https://www.uoguelph.ca/engineering/moliver).
